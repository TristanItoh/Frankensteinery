# Frankensteinery

An organ transplant operation-style arcade game made in Roblox.

## Game

You are Dr. Frankenstein, and you have a monster to experiment on... Swap its organs to various bits and bobs while watching the monster closely. Pay attention to its heart rate, blood level, and whether it has woken up. Super scary jumpscare if you let it wake up.

- Replace organs with new and improved ones!
- Move an arm around and precisely grab and drop organs.
- Pay attention to heart rate, blood level, and whether the monster is awake.
